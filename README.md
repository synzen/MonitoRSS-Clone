# Discord.RSS Clone

**This repository is only for users who will clone Discord.RSS files directly. The main repository is located at https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS.**

Driven by the lack of comprehensive RSS bots available, I have decided to try my hand at creating one of my own. Designed with as much customization as possible for both users and bot hosters, while also (or should be) easy to understand.

All documentation can be found at https://docs.discordrss.xyz/.

### Hosting on Glitch

Click the button below to import the code to Glitch. Wait for the importing process to complete, make your project private and fill in the [Configuration](https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS/wiki/Configuration). Use a tool like [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to prevent the bot from going offline.

You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for the MongoDB database and [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/) for the Redis database.

The web port for Glitch is 3000.
